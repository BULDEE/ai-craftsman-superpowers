# Why This Project Exists

## The Problem

AI coding assistants are powerful but inconsistent. They:

- **Hallucinate patterns** that don't exist or are outdated
- **Forget context** mid-conversation
- **Give generic advice** not tailored to your stack
- **Skip important steps** when pressured
- **Don't challenge** bad ideas

The result: developers either distrust AI or trust it too much.

## The Insight

What makes a senior developer valuable isn't just knowledge—it's **process**:

- They ask clarifying questions before coding
- They challenge assumptions
- They consider alternatives
- They test before shipping
- They refactor after it works

These processes are **encodable**. We can teach AI to follow them.

## The Solution

AI Craftsman Superpowers encodes senior engineering practices into:

1. **Skills**: Repeatable processes for common tasks
2. **Knowledge**: Curated patterns and principles
3. **Agents**: Automated review against standards
4. **RAG**: Grounded answers from expert content

Instead of hoping AI gives good advice, we **ensure** it follows good process.

## Design Principles

### 1. Process Over Prompts

Bad: "Write me a User entity"
Good: "Follow the 4-phase design process for a User entity"

The process ensures:
- Requirements are understood
- Alternatives are considered
- Decisions are explicit
- Implementation follows standards

### 2. Knowledge Over Training

Bad: Trust model training data (outdated, inconsistent)
Good: Curated knowledge base (current, verified, tailored)

Our knowledge is:
- Reviewed by experts
- Updated regularly
- Specific to your stack
- Searchable via RAG

### 3. Bias Protection

Bad: Let developers skip steps when pressured
Good: Catch biases and enforce discipline

Common biases we protect against:
- **Acceleration**: Coding before understanding
- **Scope creep**: Adding unrequested features
- **Over-optimization**: Premature abstraction

### 4. Transparency

Bad: AI magic that "just works"
Good: Explicit reasoning and sources

Every recommendation:
- Explains why
- Shows alternatives considered
- Cites sources when available
- Asks for confirmation

## What This Is NOT

- **Not a replacement for developers**: You make decisions, AI assists
- **Not a coding autocomplete**: This is about process, not typing speed
- **Not a magic wand**: Bad input still produces bad output
- **Not vendor lock-in**: Works with any Claude Code setup

## The Vision

A future where:

- Junior developers learn senior practices through AI guidance
- Senior developers focus on architecture while AI handles boilerplate
- Teams share encoded expertise through custom skills
- Code quality improves without slowing down delivery

## Who Is This For?

| Role | Benefit |
|------|---------|
| Junior Developer | Learn professional practices |
| Senior Developer | Encode and share expertise |
| Tech Lead | Ensure team consistency |
| Architect | Focus on design, not review |
| AI Engineer | Build intelligent systems |

## The Name

**Craftsman**: Someone who takes pride in their work, continuously improves their skills, and produces quality output.

**Superpowers**: Abilities beyond normal human capacity—speed, consistency, breadth of knowledge.

**AI-Augmented Craftsman**: A human expert amplified by AI, not replaced by it.
