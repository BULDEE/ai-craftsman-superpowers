# The AI-Augmented Craftsman Manifesto

## We Are Craftsmen

We believe software development is a craft, not a factory process.

We value:
- **Quality over speed**: Code that works today and maintains tomorrow
- **Understanding over copying**: Knowing why, not just how
- **Design over hacking**: Thinking before typing
- **Testing over hoping**: Proving correctness, not assuming it

## We Are Augmented

We embrace AI as a tool that amplifies our capabilities.

AI helps us:
- **Think deeper**: Explore more alternatives, consider more edge cases
- **Move faster**: Automate repetitive thinking, not just repetitive typing
- **Stay consistent**: Apply patterns uniformly across projects
- **Learn continuously**: Access expert knowledge on demand

## We Are Not Replaced

AI is a tool, not a replacement. We remain responsible for:

- **Architectural decisions**: AI advises, humans decide
- **Business understanding**: AI doesn't know your context
- **Quality standards**: AI follows rules, humans set them
- **Ethical judgment**: AI has no conscience

## Our Principles

### 1. Design Before Code

> "Weeks of coding can save hours of planning."

We don't start coding until we:
- Understand the problem
- Consider alternatives
- Make explicit decisions
- Define success criteria

### 2. Challenge Everything

> "The first solution is rarely the best."

We question:
- Requirements: "Is this what users actually need?"
- Design: "Is this the simplest solution?"
- Code: "Is this the right abstraction?"
- Process: "Is this step necessary?"

### 3. Test to Prove

> "Untested code is broken code waiting to be discovered."

We test to:
- Document behavior
- Enable refactoring
- Catch regressions
- Build confidence

### 4. Refactor Without Fear

> "First make it work, then make it right, then make it fast."

We improve code because:
- Tests protect us
- Small changes are safe
- Technical debt compounds

### 5. Share Knowledge

> "Knowledge hoarded is knowledge lost."

We encode expertise because:
- Skills capture process
- Knowledge bases preserve learning
- Agents automate review
- Others benefit from our experience

## Our Commitments

### To Ourselves

- We will use AI to think better, not to think less
- We will challenge AI recommendations, not blindly accept them
- We will maintain our skills, not let them atrophy
- We will stay curious, not complacent

### To Our Teams

- We will share skills that encode our expertise
- We will document decisions in ADRs
- We will review with agents, then with humans
- We will mentor others in the craft

### To Our Users

- We will build software that works
- We will build software that lasts
- We will build software that serves their needs
- We will take responsibility for our work

### To The Community

- We will contribute back what we learn
- We will help others level up
- We will maintain high standards
- We will evolve the craft
